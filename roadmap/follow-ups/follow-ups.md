# Wave Follow-ups & Deferrals — Centralized Index

**Generated:** 2026-05-01.
**Method:** Read-only sweep of every `.md` under `roadmap/` (auto-briefs, archive, and root). Three subagents covered different subtrees; output consolidated here.
**Format:** `- **<wave-or-doc>** (`<source-path>`): one-line pointer.`
**Caveat:** This is a *pointer* index. Whether each item was later completed is NOT verified — the user requested capture of every "deferred / follow-up / out-of-scope / open question" mention so nothing falls through the cracks. Cross-reference against current code/state before acting on any single entry.

## Closure manifest (2026-05-01)

45 items below have been triaged: 12 closed as DONE, 16 as SUPERSEDED, 13 as NOW-USELESS, 4 moved to `roadmap/deferred/`. Authoritative tracker: `roadmap/audit-verification-pass.md` — Triage status section. Source lines below remain unedited so the original capture is preserved verbatim; this manifest is the index. One additional item (`list_projects` 0-stat refresh) was moved from SUPERSEDED to STILL-RELEVANT after verification — see "Newly identified" section below.

### Newly identified STILL-RELEVANT

- **`list_projects` 0-stat refresh bug** (lines 121, 122, 123) — originally tagged for SUPERSEDED, but verification confirms the bug persists in current code. The `projects` table caches `node_count`/`edge_count` columns that never refresh due to an `INSERT OR REPLACE` cascade bug (`graphControllerCompat.integration.test.ts:189-193`). `handleListProjects` reads the stale cached zeros instead of calling `getNodeCount()` live. To file as a standalone wave or bundle into `graph-mcp-polish.md`/`cypher-engine-feature-additions.md`.

- **`/spec featureName` send-path is structurally broken (pre-existing, surfaced during Wave 81 smoke)** — typing `/spec myFeatureName` and pressing Enter sends the literal text as a chat message instead of running `useSpecAction` → `spec.scaffold({projectRoot, featureName})`. Root cause: `extractSlashQuery` (`src/renderer/components/AgentChat/AgentChatComposerParts.tsx:148-156`) returns `null` when the query contains whitespace, so the slash menu closes the moment the user types a space after the command name. With the menu closed, `useSlashEnter` returns false and Enter falls through to send. Selecting `/spec` from the menu while the draft is still just `/spec` (no args) calls `runSpec` with an empty `featureName` — which our Wave 81 guard correctly turns into a no-op (no more "invalid feature name" toast), but no scaffolding ever happens. Same issue affects `/remember`. **Fix path:** mirror `useResearchIntercept` (`src/renderer/components/AgentChat/AgentChatComposerSection.research.ts`) — add a send-time interceptor that catches `/spec ...` / `/remember ...` messages, parses the arg, and routes to the IDE-side action handler instead of sending as text. Roughly a 30-line addition. Discovered 2026-05-03 during Wave 81 Phase E smoke verification. Not a Wave 81 regression — predates Wave 25.

### Already filed last session (17 STILL-RELEVANT items)

See `roadmap/audit-handoff-2026-05-01.md` for the prior session's filing list. Filed in `roadmap/future/`: context-injection-completion, graph-mcp-polish, telemetry-archival-completion, agent-chat-swipe-navigation, cypher-engine-feature-additions, graph-edge-confidence-scoring, disabled-rules-honor-at-send-path, warn-hooks-stdout-surfacing, memory-curation-completion. Direct code actions: orphan DB cleanup, `agentMonitor.subagentDisplay.enabled` default flip, `accessor` keyword fixture.

### What's NOT in this manifest

The 71 NOT-DONE items (genuine outstanding follow-ups not yet filed or closed) plus the 8 PARTIAL items remain open. Audit Section D notes which audit subsections (A1 dead code, A2 dead config keys, A6 docs drift, A7 stale CLAUDE.md, Section C settings) still need their own triage passes.

---

## From wave auto-briefs

### Wave 53k (`roadmap/_archived/wave-53k/wave-53k-result.md`)
- **Wave 53k**: `codebase-memory-mcp.exe` stalls on `tools/list`; add `codemode.excludeFromMultiplex` config option.
- **Wave 53k**: Triple-keyed `~/.claude.json projects` map (forward-slash/backslash/worktree variants) still unresolved.
- **Wave 53k**: Auto-sync graph staleness — `files=0` despite file edits; change-detection not catching git-uncommitted writes.
- **Wave 53k**: Wave 53l (universal multiplexer per-spawn → user-level takeover) not yet executed.

### Wave 61 (`roadmap/wave-61-delegation-coach/wave-61-result.md`)
- **Wave 61**: Live Opus-session smoke deferred — confirm at least one nudge fires and lands in `delegation-coach.jsonl`.
- **Wave 61**: Phase F soak + analytics — run after ≥1 week; promote ≥1 pattern to ack tier or document soft-only decision.
- **Wave 61**: Pattern auto-discovery — mine JSONL for repeated tool-use sequences not in the library.
- **Wave 61**: Settings panel for per-pattern enable/disable + tier toggle in IDE settings view.
- **Wave 61**: Cross-project pattern library — currently global per user; defer until needed.
- **Wave 61**: Richer trigger DSL — 5 deferred patterns need argument fingerprinting, file-content inspection, content-size checks.
- **Wave 61**: Per-pattern-id escalation in pending state — bypass currently clears all unjoined patterns, not just hard-tier ones.
- **Wave 61**: `build:coach-hook` not wired into `postbuild`; currently a manual script.
- **Wave 61**: Hook latency telemetry — measure `detectPatterns` if Phase F shows slow-fire reports.

### Wave 62 (`roadmap/wave-62-rule-toggles/wave-62-result.md`)
- **Wave 62**: No persistent rule profiles — ephemeral only by design; persistent profiles explicitly deferred.
- **Wave 62**: Concurrent-window race — window A toggles off rule X while window B spawns sees it disabled; accepted for v1.
- **Wave 62**: No telemetry on toggle usage — deferred per scope.
- **Wave 62**: No Settings-modal mirror — user opted for popup-style surface only in v1.
- **Wave 62**: Manual smoke gate not completed — user must sign checklist before push.

### Wave 63 (`roadmap/wave-63-popover-tab-coverage/wave-63-result.md`)
- **Wave 63**: Live-path Tools enumeration (init-event capture from stream-json) deferred — static path only.
- **Wave 63**: Tool toggling via `--allowedTools` / `--disallowedTools` deferred per ADR Decision 1.
- **Wave 63**: Memory entry write/delete from popover deferred.
- **Wave 63**: Memory inline drill-down preview — `memory:read` IPC wired but unused this wave.
- **Wave 63**: Search/filter input in any popover tab out of scope.
- **Wave 63**: IDE-shell variant parity for the context-preview popover (currently chat-only only).
- **Wave 63**: User-level rules not loading in contractor-app IDE chat popover — investigate `useFilesystemDisabledRuleIds` / `loadedRules` on different cwd shape.
- **Wave 63**: Pre-existing test failure in `mobile-touch-targets.test.ts` (button height check) — tracked separately.
- **Wave 63**: Manual smoke gate not completed.

### Wave 66 (`roadmap/wave-66-graph-mcp-fixes/wave-66-result.md`)
- **Wave 66**: `manage_adr` per-ID targeting deferred — schema accepts `id`/`adr_id` but DB methods are project-scoped only.
- **Wave 66**: Confidence values on call-resolution writes — column exists (default 1.0); nuanced scoring is next iteration.
- **Wave 66**: Drop legacy parameter aliases (`name_pattern`, `function_name`, `qualified_name`, `inbound`/`outbound`) — kept for one wave per ADR Decision 2.
- **Wave 66**: `McpToolDefinition` envelope migration from `Promise<string>` to `{ isError, content }` — separate wave.
- **Wave 66**: Graph tool adoption telemetry re-measure — was 0% in 369 sessions; re-measure post-Wave-66.
- **Wave 66**: Manual smoke gate not completed.

### Wave 67 (`roadmap/wave-67-indexer-coverage-repair/wave-67-result.md`)
- **Wave 67**: Cypher engine quality bugs (confidence column access, `labels()` drop, `p.indexed_at` mismatch) — filed as Wave 68 candidate.
- **Wave 67**: `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm` upgrade for `accessor` keyword and TS 5.x features — out of scope.
- **Wave 67**: Project-wide audit of files still showing File-only nodes after reindex — if count non-trivial, file Wave 68 follow-up.
- **Wave 67**: Probe 4 (`parseAnomalies`) absent from `index_status` when count=0 — fix to always render the field.
- **Wave 67**: Probe 6 (`CALLS→Class` Cypher) returned total node count — Cypher engine ignores target-label filters in relationship patterns.

### Wave 68 (`roadmap/wave-68-cypher-engine-quality/wave-68-result.md`)
- **Wave 68**: Unsupported Cypher features — `OPTIONAL MATCH`, `WITH`, `UNWIND`, `OR` in WHERE, multi-pattern MATCH, custom aggregations. Parser rewrite needed.
- **Wave 68**: Multi-label nodes — schema stores one label per node; `labels(n)` returns string not array. Schema change required.
- **Wave 68**: `p.indexed_at` returned as Unix-ms in Cypher results — no ISO conversion at query time.
- **Wave 68**: Confidence value population — all existing edges have confidence=1.0; differentiated scoring requires `indexingPipelineCallResolution.ts` updates.

### Wave 69 (`roadmap/wave-69-context-layer-graph-integration/wave-69-result.md`)
- **Wave 69**: Manual smoke gate not completed — user must sign checklist and inspect `.context/repo-map.json`.
- **Wave 69**: B2 ranking precision — per-module COUNT(*) is coarse; switch to per-symbol scoring once cypherEngine grows GROUP BY.
- **Wave 69**: B3 ESCALATE-2 — modules with >200 outbound edges drop edges over LIMIT; revisit if Wave 70 needs tighter coverage.
- **Wave 69**: `model:` threading — `enrichPacketWithContextLayer` passes `undefined` until `TaskRequest` carries target model.
- **Wave 69**: `ModuleBoundarySignals` fields on `DetectedModule` are zero-initialized and unread — dead-code housekeeping.
- **Wave 69**: Pre-existing test failures in 5 files (mobile-touch-targets, channelCatalogCoverage, TitleBar.menus, ChatWorkbenchFollowThrough, ChatWorkbenchShell) unrelated to Wave 69.

- **Wave 52** (`roadmap/_archived/auto-briefs/wave-52-result.md`): Hook installation is manual — auto-install is Wave 53a+ follow-up; `main.ts` at 337 lines (grandfathered disable, needs split); fundamentally-IDE-only telemetry surfaces (#5,#8–11,#15–17) remain uncaptured.
- **Wave 52** (`roadmap/_archived/wave-52-audit.md`): Telemetry surfaces #5,#8,#9,#10,#11,#15,#16,#17 classified fundamentally-IDE-only and left deferred.

- **waves-15-40-review** (`roadmap/_archived/waves-15-40-review.md`): `startContextRetrainTrigger` and `contextWorker.ts` not wired — should be in root CLAUDE.md Known Issues; Codex single-turn `send` no-op not enforced at renderer UI layer; Waves 15–29 systems (agentChat, checkpoint, graph, LSP) not deeply audited.
- **waves-15-29-review-addendum** (`roadmap/_archived/waves-15-29-review-addendum.md`): SQLite compaction not wired (explicitly promised in plan); Wave 27 "30-second temporal window heuristic" in docstring not implemented; thread parentage dual-system (CRIT-C: `branchInfo` vs `parentThreadId`) structural debt — side chat drawer is a stub (HIGH-G).
- **review-handoff-waves-15-40** (`roadmap/_archived/review-handoff-waves-15-40.md`): Wave 36 Codex single-turn `send` no-op not enforced at renderer UI layer; Wave 40 knip sweep left some exports flagged but not deleted.
- **pnpm-spike** (`roadmap/_archived/pnpm-spike.md`): pnpm migration deferred — worktree `node_modules` symlinking (`worktreeManager.linkNodeModules`) also deferred; revisit when a user requests it.
- **telemetry-recovery-and-corpus-analysis** (`roadmap/_archived/telemetry-recovery-and-corpus-analysis.md`): Whether to surface telemetry status in IDE UI (indicator showing "recording") deferred to Phase 3/A.6.

## From roadmap/ (other)

### `roadmap/HANDOFF.md`
- **Wave 47 soak**: flip `layout.chatWorkbench` default to `true` when soak confirms no regressions.
- **Wave 47 soak**: widen `useWorkbenchCompare.canCompare` eligibility if users can't enter compare mode due to missing `linkedThreadId`.
- **Wave 47 soak**: HTML preview local assets — `allow-same-origin` blocks relative URLs; consider controlled asset-proxy endpoint.
- **Wave 47 soak**: tune `FORCE_FINALIZE_DELAY_MS` if sessions stay in `running` too long after agent-end defer.
- **Wave 53b follow-ups**: re-run offline ranker analysis quarterly; first target 2026-07-28.
- **Wave 53b follow-ups**: variant ranker soak — set `contextRanker.mode` to `tuned`/`experimental` and re-analyze after 100+ sessions per mode.
- **Wave 53b follow-ups**: graduation trigger — Bayesian weight optimization when corpus reaches ≥500 IDE-orchestrated sessions with hook-side Read coverage.
- **Wave 53a follow-ups**: auto-install of all four telemetry hooks lands in Phase E (not yet shipped); manual snippets in `roadmap/docs/telemetry-parity.md`.
- **Wave 53a follow-ups**: PostToolUse → file-touched-per-turn partial signal — Wave 53b decides whether worth the maintenance cost.
- **Wave 53a follow-ups**: codegen hook helper from TS schemas to eliminate comment-mirror discipline — future wave.
- **Wave 51 follow-ups**: soak `routeInternalMcp=true` for 1 week; flip default to `true` if MCP token savings confirmed and no regressions.
- **Wave 51 follow-ups**: CodeMode for user-global MCP servers (sentry, github, etc.) — separate wave, touches user-global config.
- **Wave 51 follow-ups**: `internalMcp` barrel split to remove `app` transitive import blocking unit-test imports.
- **Wave 50 follow-ups**: delete original rule files `~/.claude/rules/init-safety.md` and `project-claude-md-template.md` after one wave of slash-command soak.
- **Wave 50 follow-ups**: convert project-level rules flagged as hook candidates (9 files in `.claude/rules/`).
- **Wave 50 follow-ups**: re-run `analyze-graph-adherence.ts` quarterly; enforce `hooks.enforceGraphFirst` if adherence < 70%.
- **Wave 50 follow-ups**: make `warnFullTestSuite` agent-visible via `pre_tool_use.mjs` stdout output.

### `roadmap/deferred-task-type-aware-ranking.md`
- **Wave 69 deferral**: task-type-aware repo-map ranking deferred — needs literature check, telemetry baseline, classifier design, and A/B comparison before implementing.

### `roadmap/wave-53k-plan.md`
- **Wave 53k out-of-scope**: Wave 53l — extend CodeMode to ALL user MCP servers + external session access.
- **Wave 53k out-of-scope**: soak before flipping schema defaults (`codemode.enabled`, etc.) to `true`.
- **Wave 53k out-of-scope**: `disabledMcpServers` standardization if custom key (`_codemodeManagedServers`) is used.

### `roadmap/wave-53l-plan.md`
- **Wave 53l out-of-scope**: standalone ouroboros MCP server for IDE-off external CodeMode sessions.
- **Wave 53l out-of-scope**: reactive `~/.claude.json` watcher — pick up new MCP servers without IDE restart.
- **Wave 53l out-of-scope**: flip `codemode.enabled` default only after soak telemetry confirms multiplexer value.

### `roadmap/wave-54-plan.md`
- **Wave 54 out-of-scope**: Wave 55 candidate — `renameSymbol` / `safeDelete` gated on Phase E positive decision + preview/checkpoint/rollback maturity.
- **Wave 54 out-of-scope**: call hierarchy — lower priority; natural next op once references work.
- **Wave 54 out-of-scope**: non-TS language backends (Python/pyright, Rust/rust-analyzer, Go/gopls) — separate wave each.
- **Wave 54 out-of-scope**: semantic-op confidence scoring for incomplete results.
- **Wave 54 out-of-scope**: graph + semantic-op join for single "impact" query.
- **Wave 54 out-of-scope**: dirty-buffer correctness audit post-ship.

### `roadmap/wave-56-plan.md`
- **Wave 56 out-of-scope**: hooks/instrumentation of CodeMode tool-call stream.
- **Wave 56 out-of-scope**: streamable HTTP transport migration for ouroboros.

### `roadmap/wave-57-plan.md`
- **Wave 57 out-of-scope**: multi-level subagent nesting (depth > 1) — deferred pending real-world evidence.
- **Wave 57 out-of-scope**: sub-tool capture for chat subagents (only start/end shipped, not sub-tool calls).
- **Wave 57 out-of-scope**: cost roll-up UI for subagents — `subagentTracker.rollupCostForParent` exists; surfacing in UI is separate scope.
- **Wave 57 out-of-scope**: replace temporal-window fallback — heuristic stays; revisit after explicit-payload path is proven reliable.

### `roadmap/wave-57-phase-e-decision.md`
- **Wave 57 soak pending**: `agentMonitor.subagentDisplay.enabled` default stays `false` — soak observations not yet recorded; flip to `true` when criteria met.

### `roadmap/wave-60-standalone-ouroboros.md`
- **Wave 60 out-of-scope**: self-indexing standalone — let standalone reindex incrementally when IDE is off.
- **Wave 60 out-of-scope**: context-layer fallback tools (6 file-based read tools) for standalone when graph not yet indexed.
- **Wave 60 out-of-scope**: per-server namespace docstrings for agent discrimination.
- **Wave 60 out-of-scope**: JSON tool output migration (Wave 53l Phase C scope).
- **Wave 60 out-of-scope**: npm-package release of standalone ouroborosMcp.
- **Wave 60 manual cleanup** (`roadmap/wave-53k-followup-autosync.md`): orphan `C:\Web App\Agent IDE\codebase-graph.db*` files (7.7 MB + WAL/SHM) — safe to delete, not auto-removed.

### `roadmap/wave-61-delegation-coach.md`
- **Wave 61 out-of-scope**: coach pattern auto-discovery — mine JSONL for high-frequency unregistered tool-use sequences.
- **Wave 61 out-of-scope**: `llmJudge.ts` for the model router — reference in `src/main/router/CLAUDE.md`; build only when concrete need arises.
- **Wave 61 out-of-scope**: counterfactual sampling for tier classification — true ground-truth source; separate wave.
- **Wave 61 out-of-scope**: GUI for managing the pattern library (Settings panel with per-pattern stats + toggle).
- **Wave 61 out-of-scope**: Phase F analytics deferred if it doesn't fit the wave window — analysis recipe documented in `delegationCoach/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Wave 61 out-of-scope**: coach data analytics dashboard surfaced in IDE telemetry view.

### `roadmap/wave-62-rule-toggles.md`
- **Wave 62 open question**: confirm "first session-spawn" vs "first message" restore timing in `claudeStreamJsonRunner.ts`.
- **Wave 62 out-of-scope**: persistent / per-session rule profiles.
- **Wave 62 out-of-scope**: Settings-modal mirror for rule toggles.

### `roadmap/wave-63-popover-tab-coverage.md`
- **Wave 63 out-of-scope**: tool toggling via `--allowedTools` / `--disallowedTools` CLI flags.
- **Wave 63 out-of-scope**: memory entry inline preview (click → drawer with file content).
- **Wave 63 out-of-scope**: memory entry write/delete from popover.
- **Wave 63 out-of-scope**: search/filter input above each popover tab.
- **Wave 63 out-of-scope**: wiring the popover into the IDE-shell variant.
- **Wave 63 out-of-scope**: subagent-truncation investigation (#54018) — still biting `sonnet-implementer`.
- **Wave 63 open question**: check `AgentEventsContext` `system.init` payload for existing tool-surface emitter before adding new IPC.
- **Wave 63 open question**: decide whether to scope memory item expansion (click → inline preview) into Wave 63 or punt.

### `roadmap/wave-64-chat-session-lifecycle.md`
- **Wave 64 risk**: race where `InstructionsLoaded` fires before `SESSION_REGISTER` — file a follow-up for main-side IPC fallback if it manifests.

### `roadmap/wave-66-graph-mcp-fixes.md`
- **Wave 66 out-of-scope**: drop deprecated parameter aliases (`name_pattern`, `qualified_name`, `function_name`) after one wave transition window.
- **Wave 66 out-of-scope**: migrate `McpToolDefinition` handlers to `{ isError, content }` MCP envelope — future wave.

### `roadmap/wave-67-indexer-coverage-repair.md`
- **Wave 67 risk / deferred**: re-export-only barrel detection in `countParseAnomalies` — tune `lineCount` threshold based on post-fix data.
- **Wave 67 out-of-scope**: tree-sitter package upgrade — declared non-issue; revisit if a syntactic feature the grammar can't handle is found.

### `roadmap/wave-68-cypher-engine-quality.md`
- **Wave 68 out-of-scope**: multi-label nodes (schema has one label per node — Cypher array semantics not implemented).
- **Wave 68 out-of-scope**: unimplemented Cypher features (`OPTIONAL MATCH`, `WITH`, `UNWIND`, `OR`, subqueries, custom aggregations).
- **Wave 68 out-of-scope**: `MATCH (p:Project)-[...]->(child)` hop queries for Project node — Project routing only fixed for single-node queries.

### `roadmap/wave-69-audit.md`
- **Wave 69 escalation (P0)**: ESCALATE-1 — `languageStrategies.ts` has external callers; Phase D deletion scope must be resolved before B dispatches.
- **Wave 69 escalation (P0)**: ESCALATE-2 — `queryGraph` LIMIT 200 cap makes single-query cross-module deps infeasible; B3 must use per-module batched queries.
- **Wave 69 escalation (P1)**: ESCALATE-3 — `contextInjector.ts` and `orchestration/types.ts` not named in B1 touch points; cascade needed.
- **Wave 69 pending gate**: Phase B dispatch gated on user decision re ESCALATE-1 scope (Option A shrink vs Option B refactor).

### `roadmap/wave-69-context-layer-graph-integration.md`
- **Wave 69 out-of-scope**: task-type-aware ranking (Item 6) — deferred per `roadmap/deferred-task-type-aware-ranking.md`.
- **Wave 69 out-of-scope**: git-frequency importance signal (Item 4) — deferred; reconsider after Wave 69 settles.
- **Wave 69 out-of-scope**: AI summarizer changes (`contextLayerAiSummarizer.ts` stays as-is).
- **Wave 69 risk**: soft-fallback fires for too long — add telemetry; if fallback rate > 10%, file a graph-startup-readiness wave.
