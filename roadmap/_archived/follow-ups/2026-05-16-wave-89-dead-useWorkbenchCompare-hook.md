# Wave 89 Phase 4b — dead `useWorkbenchCompare` hook call

## Context

Phase 4b removed `ChatWorkbenchComparePane` from the shell mount tree (it was a chat-side affordance — inspect a second thread side-by-side). The hook that produced the compare state — `useWorkbenchCompare` — is still called in `src/renderer/components/Layout/ChatOnlyShell/ChatWorkbenchBody.model.ts` (per Phase 4b agent report), but its output is never consumed because the consumer (the compare pane) is gone.

Dead hook call: harmless at runtime (a few state subscriptions that produce nothing user-visible), but it's wasted work + a misleading signal for future readers.

## What to do

1. Read `src/renderer/components/Layout/ChatOnlyShell/ChatWorkbenchBody.model.ts` to confirm the dead call.
2. Remove the `useWorkbenchCompare()` call and its returned state from the model + downstream prop chains.
3. If `useWorkbenchCompare` itself has no other callers, delete the hook file too (verify with grep first).
4. Update any tests that mock or assert on the compare state.

## Why this is OPEN not BLOCKING

Hook call is dead but harmless. Tests still pass. No user-visible impact.

## Promotion criteria

Fold into a cleanup wave or the same future wave that touches `ChatWorkbenchBody.model.ts` for other reasons. Close as RESOLVED when the call is removed and tests pass.

## Resolution (wave-89-chatonly-shell-layout-overhaul)

Closed by `haiku-followup-auditor` during wave audit on 2026-05-20.
Evidence: Code inspection confirms `useWorkbenchCompare()` is called in `ChatWorkbenchBody.model.ts:72` and returned state is added to `WorkbenchContextState`, but the `compare` prop is destructured in `TwoTierRailSurface` (line 238, `ChatWorkbenchBody.rails.tsx`) and immediately excluded from downstream wiring. Zero usage of `compare.*` in component tree. Hook output is dead code. Note: The hook's source consumer (ChatWorkbenchComparePane) was removed in Wave 95 Phase H continuation, retroactively validating this as dead code that should have been cleaned in Wave 89 wrap.
