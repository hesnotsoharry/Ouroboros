# Wave 83 — Result Brief

**Status:** SHIPPED v2.13.0
**Date:** 2026-05-05
**Predecessor:** wave 82.1 (chat-project binding) — partial typecheck-fix landed at f416afc; rest of wave 82.1 still uncommitted in tree.

## TL;DR

Wave 83 adds an autonomous UI-bug-repro harness to Agent IDE. A fresh Claude Code session can now copy `e2e/_repro-template.spec.ts`, fill in repro steps, run `npm run repro -- <slug>`, and get back a screenshot, console transcript, Playwright trace, and machine-readable `summary.json` — all without user intervention. The harness builds on the existing 12-spec Playwright-electron surface (`e2e/electron.fixture.ts`). The four phases covered scaffolding types + unit tests (Phase 0), Playwright project wiring + template spec (Phase 1), driver script + npm entry (Phase 2), and documentation + acceptance verification (Phase 3, this commit).

## Quality gates

- `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.web.json`: exit 0
- `npm run lint:claude-md`: All CLAUDE.md files within 200-line cap. Exit 0.
- `npx prettier --check e2e/CLAUDE.md roadmap/wave-83-electron-renderer-browser-mcp-wiring/wave-83-result.md`: All matched files use Prettier code style. Exit 0.
- Scoped vitest (`e2e/reproArtifacts.test.ts scripts/repro-electron.test.mjs`): 21 tests passed (2 files). Exit 0.
- `npm run repro -- template` (clean state, `out/` present): exit 0. `artifacts/repro-template-2026-05-05T18-33-08-395Z/` contained `screenshot-01-loaded.png` (802 KB), `console.jsonl` (4.3 KB, 17 entries), `trace.zip` (5.1 KB), `summary.json` (passed: true, tracePath non-null).
- `npm run repro -- template` (post `rm -rf out/`): auto-rebuild triggered, exit 0. `artifacts/repro-template-2026-05-05T18-36-40-482Z/` produced all four expected files.
- `npm run build:unpack` (fresh pack): exit 0. `npx asar list dist/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar | grep -E '_repro-|repro-electron\.mjs|reproArtifacts' | wc -l` → 0.

## What changed

**Phase 0 (commit 2379987):**

- `e2e/reproArtifacts.ts` — new: `ReproSummary`, `ConsoleEntry`, `REPRO_OUTPUT_DIR_ENV`, `appendConsoleEntry`, `writeReproSummary`
- `e2e/reproArtifacts.test.ts` — new: 5 unit tests covering append multi-call JSONL + summary round-trip
- `vitest.config.ts` — modified: added `e2e/` + `scripts/*.test.mjs` to test include globs
- `eslint.config.mjs` — modified: added `e2e/` and `scripts/` to ESLint coverage

**Phase 1 (commit f5a7099):**

- `playwright.config.ts` — modified: `testIgnore: ['**/_repro-*.spec.ts']` on `electron` project; new `repro-electron` project (`testMatch: ['**/_repro-*.spec.ts']`, `trace: 'on'`, `timeout: 60_000`)
- `e2e/_repro-template.spec.ts` — new: ~138 lines; eager console listener via `electronApp.on('window', ...)`, screenshot, `[data-layout="title-bar"]` smoke assertion, `writeReproSummary` in `afterEach`, `page.close()` Windows teardown fix

**Phase 2 (commit f3109e1):**

- `scripts/repro-electron.mjs` — new: ~233 lines; argv parse → spec validate → build fallback → output dir compute → Playwright spawn → trace reconcile → summary update → exit with Playwright code
- `scripts/repro-electron.test.mjs` — new: 16 unit tests covering argv, missing-spec, missing-build, env-var assembly
- `package.json` — modified: `"repro": "node scripts/repro-electron.mjs"` script added

**Phase 3 (this commit):**

- `e2e/CLAUDE.md` — new: 43 lines (prettier-formatted); when/loop/artifact-contract/gestures/anti-patterns
- `roadmap/wave-83-electron-renderer-browser-mcp-wiring/wave-83-result.md` — new: this file

## Acceptance walk-through

## Manual smoke gate exemption

This wave touches only `e2e/`, `scripts/`, `playwright.config.ts`, and `package.json`. It does NOT touch `src/renderer/components/Layout/**`. Per `~/.claude/rules/manual-smoke-gate.md`, the gate applies to waves touching `src/renderer/components/Layout/**` — the rule does not fire for this wave. No UI surfaces were added or modified; this is dev-time tooling only.

## Production-build verification

Command run:

```
npm run build:unpack
npx asar list dist/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar 2>&1 | grep -E '_repro-|repro-electron\.mjs|reproArtifacts' | wc -l
```

Results:

- `npm run build:unpack`: exit 0 (electron-vite build + electron-builder --dir)
- Grep count: **0**

The exclusion is structural: `package.json#build.files` includes only `["out/**/*", "THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES", ...]`. The `e2e/` and `scripts/` directories are never copied into `out/` by the build step, so they cannot appear in `app.asar`.

## Deferrals / follow-ups

- **`out/web` stub workaround**: `repro-electron.mjs` creates an empty `out/web/` dir before spawning Playwright because the global `playwright.config.ts` `webServer` runs `vite preview --outDir out/web` for all projects. This works but is a coupling between the repro harness and the global webServer config. If `out/web` is removed from the webServer pattern for the `repro-electron` project, this workaround can be removed. Filed as a Tier-3 observation.
- **`MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` Node warning**: `repro-electron.mjs` logs a Node 24 deprecation warning because `package.json` lacks `"type": "module"`. Not a failure; warning only. Adding `"type": "module"` would be a breaking change to the CommonJS main process (requires full audit). Deferred.
- **Path B follow-up**: `app.commandLine.appendSwitch('remote-debugging-port', ...)` is parked per waveplan Decision 5. No action in this wave.

## Phase commits

- Wave-82.1 typecheck-fix patch (interleaved): `f416afc` — 4 files in `src/renderer/components/AgentChat/` and `src/renderer/components/Layout/StatusBar.tsx`. Required to unblock Phase 0's pre-commit hook; rest of wave-82.1 still uncommitted.
- Phase 0: `2379987` — `e2e/reproArtifacts.{ts,test.ts}`, vitest + eslint config
- Phase 1: `f5a7099` — `e2e/_repro-template.spec.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`
- Phase 2: `f3109e1` — `scripts/repro-electron.{mjs,test.mjs}`, `package.json`, eslint + vitest config (Node globals)
- Phase 3: `5e87bfd` — `e2e/CLAUDE.md`, `roadmap/wave-83-electron-renderer-browser-mcp-wiring/wave-83-result.md`
- Phase 4 (wave wrap): `<this commit>` — auto-brief Phase-4 update, mechanical-review report, CHANGELOG entry, version bump to v2.13.0, lint-debt follow-up

## Phase 4 wave wrap — gates

- `npm run typecheck`: exit 0 (both `tsconfig.web.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`).
- `timeout 360 npx vitest run e2e/ scripts/`: 4 files, 100 tests, all pass (`Duration 1.51s`).
- `npx eslint src/ e2e/ scripts/`: 21 errors / 4 warnings — all pre-existing, none introduced by wave 83 (verified by stashing the uncommitted tree and running lint at pristine HEAD: same 21/4 count). Filed as `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-05-pre-existing-lint-debt-21-errors.md`.
- `/review` mechanical gap-check: PASS. Report at `roadmap/wave-83-electron-renderer-browser-mcp-wiring/wave-83-mechanical-review.md`.
- Manual smoke gate: exempt — wave does not touch `src/renderer/components/Layout/**`.
