# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.19.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- **Wave 97 — Shared-Types Extraction.** Eliminates the renderer/main `ClaudeCliSettings` drift that Wave 96 worked around with an in-place sync. Pure type-only refactor, no behavior change. Full story in `roadmap/wave-97-shared-types-extraction/wave-97-result.md`.
  - **New canonical home for CLI-integration settings interfaces** at `src/shared/types/configSlices.ts`. Owns the definitions for `ClaudeCliSettings` (15 fields, full JSDoc) and `CodexCliSettings` (9 fields, full JSDoc).
  - **Phase A** — `src/main/configTypes.ts` becomes a re-export shim: `export type { ClaudeCliSettings, CodexCliSettings } from '@shared/types/configSlices';`. Every main-side consumer keeps working unchanged (no import-path sweep). Net −48 lines in `configTypes.ts` (344 → 296, well under the 300-line ESLint limit).
  - **Phase C** — `src/renderer/types/electron-foundation.d.ts` deletes the duplicate interface definitions and replaces with `import type { ... } from '@shared/types/configSlices';` + matching re-export. The renderer's `useClaudeCliSettings.ts` resolves through the same barrel. New fields no longer need hand-mirroring between sides.
  - **W96 gotcha entry removed** from `src/renderer/types/CLAUDE.md` — the "until Wave 97 unifies them" line is gone.
  - **Phase B no-op** — Phase 0 inventory found ~60 orchestration symbol re-exports from `main/orchestration/types` into the renderer, but those are NOT duplicated (no drift) and `tsconfig.web.json:30-33` already explicitly includes the 4 main/orchestration type files. Soft cap (≤10) exceeded; orchestration relocation deferred to a dedicated future wave focused on the architectural cleanliness rule. Follow-up: `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-19-orchestration-types-relocation.md`.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-97-shared-types-extraction/wave-97-decisions.md`)
- D1: Module location — single `src/shared/types/configSlices.ts` (matches in-repo convention).
- D2: Import-path stability — re-export shim in `configTypes.ts`; no consumer sweep.
- D3: Orchestration scope — inventory-gated; verdict NO-OP this wave.
- D4: Renderer-local `ClaudeCliSettings` — delete outright (internal-only, not deprecated).
- D5: Semver tier — patch (`v2.19.2`); pure type correctness, no runtime change.

## [2.19.1] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Wave 95 — Chat-Workbench Terminal Quality-of-Life.** Fix-sweep wave bundling 7 work phases (B/A/C/D/E/H/G + Path 1 extension). Polishes the terminal-first chat workbench surfaced by Wave 94 and consolidates the diff-review surface. Full story in `roadmap/wave-95-chat-workbench-terminal-qol/wave-95-result.md`.
  - **Terminal scrollback config** (Phase B). `terminal.scrollback` config key (default 50000, min 1000, max 100000); plumbed from electron-store through `useTerminalConfig` to xterm's `scrollback` option. Long Claude TUI streams no longer lose history mid-session.
  - **Terminal tab rename** (Phase A). Double-click a dock-slot tab title OR right-click an inner-rail row to rename. `userRenamed: boolean` flag on `SessionTabRef` persists the rename; subsequent PTY `titleChange` events are suppressed via a wrapping `buildTitleChangeHandler` in `useProjectTerminals.SlotHandle`. New shared `InlineTitleEdit` primitive (Enter/blur commits if non-empty AND differs; Escape always cancels). Wave-wide consistency.
  - **Ghost-cursor fix** (Phase C). Local postinstall patcher (`tools/apply-patches.mjs`) applies the fix from upstream `xtermjs/xterm.js#5883` (atlas page-merge corruption) to the minified `@xterm/addon-webgl@0.19.0` bundle. SHA-256 idempotency guard; original + patched snapshots in `patches/`. Removal flow documented at `patches/README.md` — bump to `^0.19.1` once upstream ships.
  - **Claude TUI rendering** (Phase D). `buildXtermTheme()` now reads `--palette-term-bg` (opaque `#0c0c0e`) instead of `--term-bg` (forced transparent by the glass theme bridge). Claude TUI fill cells (status panel boxes, bordered regions) render with correct dark-panel backgrounds. Glass aesthetic preserved on chrome surfaces. `[trace:osc]` baseline instrumentation added to OSC 10/11/12 handlers.
  - **Tinted-glass canvas opt-in** (Phase D extension). New `--terminal-canvas-opacity` CSS var (default `1`). Themes may override to `0.85-0.95` for a faint glass effect over the opaque canvas. xterm.js fundamentally can't do per-cell selective transparency (`xtermjs/xterm.js#1004`, unresolved since 2018), so this CSS-opacity approach matches Warp / Hyper conventions.
  - **Secondary dock slot hides when empty** (Phase E). When `collapsed && !hasSessions`, the secondary `DockSlot` no longer renders (was: 28px chrome bar bug from Wave 89 polish). Distinct "▼ Show slot" bordered button appears on the primary slot's header to summon it back. `useSecondarySlotVisible` predicate reads `useProjectTerminalsContext` session count.
  - **Dock-slot ResizeObserver fill** (Phase E hardening, pre-existing Wave 89 bug). `useSectionHeight` measures the actual dock section height via `ResizeObserver`; `computeSlotDisplayHeights` ratios scale to that height instead of the stale `sizes.terminal` IDE-shell value. Dock slots now sum to the section height — no leftover empty space below the secondary.
  - **Diff-review surface consolidation** (Phase H, RESHAPED). Removed `ChatWorkbenchArtifactPane` entirely + the utility-drawer `review` tab. Single surviving surface: `ChatOnlyDiffOverlay` (full-screen, user-summoned via the status-bar `DiffButton`). Auto-open wiring on `useWorkbenchSurfacePolicy` removed. Net: -1094 lines, 4 files deleted. The "constantly experiencing pop ups while using the app" pain is resolved.
  - **Multi-project diff state** (Phase G, RESHAPED). `DiffReviewState` now holds an array of `ProjectReview` entries keyed by `projectRoot`. Reducer OPEN merges (same project replaces, new project prepends) instead of clobbering. `FileListSidebar` renders collapsible per-project groups (`▼ <project-name> (N files)`) with per-group expanded state. New `CLOSE_PROJECT(projectRoot)` action; `SET_ACTIVE_PROJECT` for cross-group navigation. All hunk/file actions accept `projectRoot` as first parameter. `usePendingDiffCount` sums across all projects. Concurrent Claude edits from different terminals (in-IDE or external) now accumulate visibly grouped instead of clobbering each other.

### Changed
- **`@xterm/addon-webgl` bundle patched at install time** via `tools/apply-patches.mjs` (postinstall script chain). Self-contained, no new deps, no lockfile-sync required.
- **`buildXtermTheme()` background source** swapped from `--term-bg` (transparent) to `--palette-term-bg` (opaque). Glass theme bridge unchanged — only the xterm canvas reads the opaque variant.
- **Diff-review state shape** is now multi-project (`{ projects: ProjectReview[]; activeProjectRoot } | null`). Single-project consumers (status-bar count, workbench timeline, editor hunk decorations) updated to iterate across projects. All Phase G's reducer/action changes preserve the Wave 94 Phase E `openReview` signature contract — boundary acceptance test still passes 5/5 unchanged.
- **Default scrollback for new terminal sessions** bumped from 1000 (xterm.js default) → 50000. ~50 MB per terminal at default, documented in `Terminal/CLAUDE.md`.
- **`useWorkbenchSurfacePolicy`** no longer accepts `diffKey`; the auto-open useEffect for the utility drawer's review tab is removed. Approval and subagent-panel auto-open effects unchanged.
- **`ChatWorkbenchUtilityTab` type** narrowed from `'activity' | 'approvals' | 'rules' | 'monitor' | 'review'` → `'activity' | 'approvals' | 'rules' | 'monitor'`. Persistence migration: stored `'review'` values fall back to `'activity'`.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-95-chat-workbench-terminal-qol/wave-95-decisions.md`)
- D1: PTY titleChange precedence — permanent stick (industry standard).
- D2: Default scrollback — 50000 lines.
- D3: Ghost-cursor fix — keep WebGL, vendor PR #5883 via postinstall patcher.
- D4: TUI render correctness — opaque canvas via `--palette-term-bg`; OSC 11 read-allow deferred.
- D5: Secondary slot collapsed-empty — Option B (hide entirely + show-slot affordance), preceded by Lane B mini-investigation that confirmed the regression.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **Wave 94 — Chat-Workbench Completion.** Closes the five contract gaps surfaced by the Wave 89 deferred smoke walk — surfaces left half-wired by Wave 89's mid-flight terminal-first pivot. Full story in `roadmap/wave-94-chat-workbench-completion/wave-94-result.md`.
  - **Title-bar surface split** (Phase A). Two distinct toggle buttons (`UtilityPaneToggleButton` + `ArtifactPaneToggleButton`) replace the cycling single right-pane button. Each surface is independently discoverable — Activity / Approvals / Monitor / Rules no longer reachable only via implicit auto-open events. `useChatWorkbenchLayout` exposes `isUtilityOpen` / `isArtifactOpen` aliases. Backward-compat `toggleRightPane` + `lastRightPaneView` cycling preserved for keyboard-shortcut consumers. `TitleBarWindowControls` extracted from `ChatOnlyTitleBar` to stay under the 300-line cap.
  - **Per-project terminal isolation** (Phase B). New `useProjectTerminals(activeProjectPath)` hook + `ProjectTerminalsProvider` mounted once in `ChatWorkbenchShell`. Switching the active project on the outer rail atomically swaps both dock slots' session sets; sessions persist per-project across switches and restarts. New electron-store key `terminalSessionsPerProject` (Record<projectPath, ProjectTerminalState>) with no migration — sessions are runtime state, not durable user content. New shared Zod schema in `src/shared/config/projectTerminalsSchema.ts`. Both `DockSlot` and `InnerSidebarTerminals` consume via `useProjectTerminalsContext()`.
  - **Terminal tabs in dock slots** (Phase C). New `DockSlotTabs` pure tab strip component. Each slot's `+ New` appends rather than replaces — previous sessions stay selectable. Tab strip replaces the slot label (`Primary` / `Shell`) when sessions exist; empty-slot retains the legacy label. Active-tab activate-neighbour-before-close ordering preserves index validity. Tab persistence per slot per project via Phase B's `activeSessionPerSlot` schema field.
  - **Inner-rail Terminals integration** (Phase D). `InnerSidebarTerminals` rendered as per-slot session groups (Primary / Shell, empty groups skipped). Single-click activates session in its current slot. `+ New` spawns into the primary slot by default; right-click on the button opens a context menu for explicit slot pick. No more orphaned sessions from rail spawn.
  - **Diff-review producer wiring** (Phase E). Terminal Claude sessions' write-class tool calls (`Write` / `Edit` / `MultiEdit`) trigger automatic diff-review open. Producer: `assets/hooks/post_tool_use.mjs` forwards file paths; new `src/main/hooksDiffReview.ts` tap (registered via existing `hooksTapRunner`) captures pre-snapshot via `git rev-parse HEAD`, dispatches synthetic `diff_review_ready` agent event on matching `post_tool_use`. Consumer: new `useDiffReviewTrigger` hook in `ChatWorkbenchShell` subscribes via `window.electronAPI.hooks.onAgentEvent`, filters by event type / settings gate / per-window owned-session set. New `ClaudeCliSettings.enableTerminalDiffReview` setting (default `true`); off-switch exists if `git rev-parse` latency bites. Stash TTL of 60s prevents unbounded growth if `post_tool_use` never arrives.
  - **`useClaudeCliSettings` + `useOwnedSessionIds` hooks** (Phase E). Thin readers over existing config + terminal-sessions surfaces; reusable for future settings/session-ownership consumers.

### Changed
- **`InnerSidebarTerminals` source-of-truth** switched from `terminal?: UseTerminalSessionsReturn` prop to `useProjectTerminalsContext()`. The "Terminals are not available" empty-state branch is replaced by per-slot empty-state rendering (the `+ New terminal` button always present via the context FALLBACK).
- **`DockSlot.tsx`** no longer mounts its own `useTerminalSessions()` per slot. Reads from `useProjectTerminalsContext()` instead — single global PTY pool, per-project session segmentation in renderer-side state only.
- **`ChatWorkbenchShell.tsx`** wraps its tree in `ProjectTerminalsProvider activeProjectPath={projectRoot}` and mounts `useDiffReviewTrigger()` inside `useShellState` (chat-workbench scope only, not IDE shell).
- **`eslint.config.mjs`** Node-globals override expanded from `scripts/**/*.mjs` to also cover `assets/hooks/*.mjs` (pre-existing lint gap exposed by Phase E's hook script edit).

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-94-chat-workbench-completion/wave-94-decisions.md`)
- D1: Title-bar surface split — Option A (two distinct buttons). B/C leave utility partially hidden behind extra interaction.
- D2: Per-project terminal state — 2a (`useProjectTerminals` hook, Map shape, atomic swap). 2b leaves dock slots sharing a global pool; 2c overloads `ProjectContext` with PTY runtime state.
- D3: Diff-review snapshot — 3b (opt-in setting, default `true`). Matches `feedback_defaults_true` convention; race-condition complexity of 3c (background async) avoided pre-launch.
- D4: Rail promote semantics — 4a (single-click activate + right-click slot-choice). VS Code parity.
- D5: Tab strip placement — 5a (replace label when sessions exist). Sessions ARE the slot's identity once spawned.

### Boundary phase discipline
Phase E was authored as a boundary phase per `~/.claude/rules/orchestrator-owned-acceptance-tests.md` — orchestrator-owned acceptance test (`src/renderer/hooks/useDiffReviewTrigger.acceptance.test.tsx`, 5 criteria) shipped as `describe.skip(...)` at `abc04d66`, un-skipped at Phase E dispatch, all 5 pass post-implementation. Test enforces: event-shape contract, settings gate, cross-window filter, event-type filter, multi-event isolation. Implementer cannot modify the test; only orchestrator-permitted modifications applied (un-skip + `@vitest-environment jsdom` infrastructure docblock).

## [2.18.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Wave 89 — ChatOnlyShell Terminal-First Pivot.** Started as a chat-shell layout overhaul (two-slot stacked terminals + overlay drawers); mid-wave the strategic direction shifted to terminal-first (subscription Claude → CLI-only substrate → chat-bubble UI becomes vestigial post-Wave-90). Full story in `roadmap/wave-89-chatonly-shell-layout-overhaul/wave-89-result.md`.
  - **Two-slot stacked terminal dock.** `DockSlot.tsx` per-slot component with independent `useTerminalSessions`; `useDockSlotHeights` orchestrates per-slot height persistence + drag math; sibling-resizable divider via `useResizable.startSiblingResize` (Phase 0). `SPLIT_TERMINAL_EVENT` payload extended with `{ slot, sessionId }` discriminator + `'primary'` fallback for legacy dispatch sites.
  - **Per-slot collapse affordance** (Phase 4c). `▾`/`▴` per slot — collapses to 28px header strip, sibling grows to fill. Both slots can collapse simultaneously. Collapsed state persists across restart via `terminalDockSlotsCollapsed` schema field. `+New` stays visible when collapsed (so spawning re-opens); `Rec`/`✕` hide.
  - **`OverlayDrawer` primitive** (Phase 2). Non-modal slide-in drawer anchored to nearest positioned ancestor (not viewport). Z-index 200. Mica/vibrancy-safe `rgba(0,0,0,0.35)` backdrop. Window-scoped Escape with `stopPropagation` (jsdom div-handlers don't propagate reliably; non-modal contract honored — composer Escape works when drawer closed). Width-handle drag on the left edge; primitive renders the handle, consumer persists width.
  - **`useResizable.startSiblingResize`** (Phase 0). New function alongside existing positional `startResize`; pure math extracted to `useResizable.sibling.ts`. Additive `onCommit` callback added to `SiblingResizeOpts` (Phase 1 revision) so consumers can route commits to non-`panelSizes` persistence schemas (`terminalDockSlots`) while still using the unified drag mechanic. Honors ADR Decision 1 (single resize source of truth).
  - **`dockPersistenceSchema.ts`** declares `terminalDockSlots: { primary, secondary }`, `terminalDockSlotsCollapsed: { primary, secondary }`, `overlayDrawerWidth`, `artifactOverlayWidth`. One-time forward-migration from legacy `dockHeight` via 60/40 split.
  - **`WorkbenchModelChips`** in `ChatOnlyTitleBar` (Phase 4b, Cole's call). Model + permission chips relocated from `ChatStatusChipRow` (below composer) to the title bar — between project label and exit button. Compact chip styling.

### Changed
- **ChatOnlyShell desktop composition is now `rail | dock-main-area`** — no chat surface, no fixed-flex right-side surfaces. Utility drawer + artifact pane render as `OverlayDrawer` instances anchored to the dock-main-area; both can be concurrently open (tile layout: artifact right, utility left of artifact). Mobile path (`MobileOverlay`-wrapped surfaces) unchanged. `useChatWorkbenchLayout` mutual-exclusion between utility and artifact removed. `useWorkbenchSurfacePolicy` unchanged (state-only; the existing dismissal-tracking carries forward to overlays).
- **`ChatWorkbenchTerminalDock`** refactored from single-pane with bottom-edge resize to two-slot stack filling the full main area. `DockResizeHandle` removed (no chat sibling to resize against). `DockHeader` + `DockCloseButton` removed (per-slot collapse replaces the whole-dock toggle).

### Removed (from ChatOnlyShell mount tree only — code preserved for IDE shell)
- **`AgentChatWorkspace`** mount, **`FloatingComposerContainer`**, **`ChatStatusChipRow`** (chips relocated to title bar), **`WorkbenchApprovalSurface`**-inside-chat, **`ChatWorkbenchComparePane`**, **`ChatHistorySidebar`** (replaced by `WorkbenchRail`'s Wave-47 session-list groups for session listing).
- **`dock.visible` / `onToggleTerminal`** state + handler from the workbench shell (per-slot collapse replaces it). `useTerminalDockState.visible` still serves the IDE-shell `TerminalPane` — untouched.
- **`useDockHandlers`** (dead Wave-88 single-dock helper, deleted in `e11ef53c` after a runtime crash). The only consumed handler (`handleResizePointerDown`) was inlined into `useDockState`.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-89-chatonly-shell-layout-overhaul/wave-89-decisions.md`)
- D1: Sibling-stack resize via `useResizable` extension, not a separate hook. Emerging best practice (Allotment / react-resizable-panels pattern).
- D2: Two distinct slots each with own `TerminalManager` session (not tabbed multiplexing).
- D3: BOTH utility drawer AND artifact pane migrate to `OverlayDrawer` (Cole's call, Option A).
- D4: Overlays non-modal, anchored to a positioned ancestor (not viewport).
- D5: Persistence schema extension via one-time forward migration from legacy `dockHeight`.
- D6: Migration UX: auto-switch silently (no opt-in toggle).
- D7 (mid-wave pivot, 2026-05-16): Terminal-first ChatOnlyShell. `AgentChat` code stays in place; only the chat-only shell mount tree changes. Archive-move deferred.

### Known issues at ship
- **Manual smoke gate DEFERRED** — `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-16-wave-89-deferred-smoke-gate.md`. Cole's call: walk after the hang fix lands (the hang interrupts smoke).
- **Main-thread hang (pre-existing)** — `roadmap/bugs/2026-05-16-main-thread-hang-on-context-rebuild.md`. 2.5-minute UI freeze when `generateRepoMap` runs ~200 synchronous SQLite Cypher queries post-graph-rebuild. Diagnostician identified root cause; partial instrumentation landed. Next Lane B fix wave.
- Three Wave-89 deferred items in `roadmap/follow-ups/`: tool-bridge runtime smoke, stacked-dock integration test, dead `useWorkbenchCompare` hook cleanup.

### Risk acceptance
Shipped on local Windows gates only — CI minutes still exhausted from Wave 92/93 burst (refresh ~2026-06-01). No manual smoke gate. Risk bounded: surfaces are tightly scoped; visual regressions surface immediately in regular use.

## [2.17.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Wave 93 — Fix Sweep: Lockfile Drift Check + Cleanups.** Four small follow-ups bundled into a single patch wave; ~3 hours wall-clock.
  - **`scripts/lockfile-drift-check.mjs`** + `npm run lockfile:check:drift` — diffs old vs new `package-lock.json`, classifies version changes by severity (patch/minor/major/prerelease/added/removed), exits 2 on minor+ unless `--accept-drift` is passed. Wired into `scripts/lockfile-sync.mjs` post-regen so any drift gates marker-write. Defense in depth with the Wave 92 pre-push guard: drift-check is the warning, pre-push guard is the gate. Closes the Wave 92 transitive-drift gap (`roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-16-pin-toplevel-transitive-gap.md`). 176 lines, 6 vitest cases, no external deps.
  - **`src/main/codebaseGraph/treeSitterParser.integration.test.ts`** — orchestrator-authored boundary acceptance test for the tree-sitter ABI 15 contract.
  - **`.claude/vendor-gotchas/tree-sitter.md`** — captures the 0.22→0.26 migration lessons (named-export rewrite, wasm export-key resolution, `Parser.SyntaxNode → Node` rename).

### Changed
- **`web-tree-sitter`** bumped `0.22.6` → `^0.26.8` (ABI 15 support; landed in 0.25.0). Code adapted to the 0.25+ named-export API: `Parser`/`Language`/`Node` are top-level exports (`Parser.SyntaxNode` → `Node` across 5 files); `require.resolve('web-tree-sitter/web-tree-sitter.wasm')` for the `locateFile` callback (the wasm asset is now an explicit export key, not co-located with the JS entry). Codebase-graph indexing of javascript/python now loads `@vscode/tree-sitter-wasm@0.3.1` ABI 15 grammars cleanly instead of silently falling back to `tree-sitter-wasms@0.1.13`. Closes the tree-sitter half of `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-13-tailwind-codepoint-and-treesitter-wasm-versions.md`.
- **Trace-logging silenced**: 5 `log.info` → `log.debug` edits across 4 files (`src/main/hooksDispatchLogic.ts`, `src/renderer/components/AgentChat/ComposerContextPreview.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentChat/ContextPreview.popover.tsx`, `src/renderer/hooks/useAgentEvents.ruleSkillDispatchers.ts`) for the `[trace:agent-record]` and `[trace:ctx-preview]` diagnostic tags. Traces preserved for the still-open eviction-bug investigations; `electron-log`'s renderer console transport defaults to `info` so debug lines are silently dropped unless a developer enables them. Closes `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-14-trace-logging-floods-console.md`.
- **`roadmap/HANDOFF.md`** lockfile section: removed the `--package-lock-only` workaround note; replaced with current drift-check guidance.

### Removed
- **`src/renderer/components/Layout/ChatOnlyShell/SubagentTranscriptPanel.tsx`** — defined and exported but never mounted in production (`OPEN_SUBAGENT_PANEL_EVENT` routes to the `monitor` tab via `useWorkbenchSurfacePolicy`'s `openUtility({ tab: 'monitor' })`, a deliberate Wave-47-era consolidation). Cleaned up the ChatOnlyShell `CLAUDE.md` composition tree and removed a stale `SubagentTranscriptPanel` mention from `ChatWorkbenchFollowThrough.integration.test.tsx`. Closes `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-14-subagent-transcript-panel-dead-code.md`.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-93-fix-sweep-drift-and-cleanups/wave-93-decisions.md`)
- D1: drift-check via diff-and-warn script (not bulk `overrides`, not pnpm migration).
- D2: fail on minor+, warn on patch. `--accept-drift` (or `LOCKFILE_SYNC_ACCEPT_DRIFT=1`) is the human-override path.
- D3: drift-check runs post-regen, gates marker-write. Defense in depth with the Wave 92 pre-push guard.
- D4: `web-tree-sitter` target 0.26.8 (current stable; forward-pin not hold-back).
- D5: trace-logging lower to `log.debug` (not delete; not new debug-flag mechanism).
- D6: `SubagentTranscriptPanel` deleted (not re-mounted) — honors the `monitor`-tab consolidation.

---

## [2.17.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Wave 92 — Cross-Platform Lockfile Foundation + Stryker Activation.** Adopted Gamify Wave 9's lockfile-foundation pattern preventatively, then installed Stryker on top. Agent IDE had no existing lockfile divergence; installing Stryker would have been the trigger (its `vitest-runner` historically pulled the optional-subtree shape that Windows npm skips), so the foundation lands first. 9 phases, 9 commits.
  - **`scripts/lockfile-sync.mjs`** + `npm run lockfile:sync` — drives a WSL2-native from-scratch `npm install` against `~/lockgen/agent-ide/` (ext4) at Node 20.20.2, copies only `package-lock.json` back to the Windows repo. Never touches the Windows `node_modules/`. Writes `.lockfile-sync.marker` as provenance. 68s on warm cache.
  - **`scripts/lockfile-check.mjs`** + `npm run lockfile:check` — validates marker sha256 matches lockfile sha256. Advisory bypass via `LOCKFILE_SYNC_GUARD_BYPASS=1`.
  - **`scripts/hooks/pre-push`** (POSIX shell) — blocks any push whose `package-lock.json` change lacks a valid marker. Install once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks`. Background in `scripts/hooks/README.md`.
  - **CI canary** — `ci.yml` step "Lockfile cross-platform completeness check" runs `node scripts/lockfile-smoke.mjs` on all 3 OS after `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. Catches incomplete lockfiles on every PR.
  - **`scripts/lockfile-smoke.mjs`** + **`scripts/pin-toplevel.mjs`** (verbatim from Gamify) — completeness check + version-preservation helpers.
  - **`stryker.config.mjs`** — `@stryker-mutator/core@^9.6.1` + `@stryker-mutator/vitest-runner@^9.6.1`. Mutate scope tight at `src/shared/**` (174 mutants, 31 source files). `vitest.configFile` wired to project's config; `testFiles` restricted to shared-layer tests. `break: 21` (anti-backslide floor at floor(22.41) - 1).
  - **`.github/workflows/ci-stryker.yml`** — dual-frequency: `mutation-incremental` on PR + push to master, `mutation-full` on weekly Monday cron. Enforces `break: 21`.
  - **`npm run mutation:test`** + **`mutation:test:full`** scripts.
  - **`.nvmrc`** (`20`) at repo root.
  - **Three vendor-gotcha files** at `.claude/vendor-gotchas/`: `wsl2-lockgen.md` + `stryker.md` (ported from Gamify Wave 9, inherited lessons) + NEW `stryker-electron.md` (Agent-IDE-native: 4-module no-touch list, subsystem-boundary expansion pattern, two load-bearing config options found at Phase 6).
  - **`CLAUDE.md` "Lockfile" subsection** documenting the regen-only-via-lockfile-sync rule + pre-push hook install.

### Fixed
- Acceptance-test test-theater incident in Phase 7: subagent's first attempt at `ci-stryker.yml` added inline YAML comments matching the acceptance-test regex (which had a bug — extraction stopped at the first indented `\w+:` line). Orchestrator fixed the regex (`(?![\s\S])` for end-of-input — JS has no `\Z` anchor) AND removed the comments. Final test validates real workflow structure.
- Dead-code guard removed from `scripts/lockfile-check.mjs` `readMarker()` catch block (`process.exit()` is terminal; `ERR_PROCESS_EXIT_CODE` guard unreachable). Surfaced by phase-reviewer.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-92-cross-platform-lockfile-stryker/wave-92-decisions.md`)
- Inherit Gamify Wave 9 pattern wholesale; Agent IDE deltas applied (Node 20, master branch, single-manifest, 3-OS CI matrix).
- Lockfile generation: WSL2-native ext4, single-pass `npm install --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` (no `--os` flags needed at Node 20.20.2 / npm 10.8.2). Empirically pinned by Phase 1 walking skeleton.
- Stryker mutate scope tightly bound to `src/shared/**` v1; expansion to subsystem-boundary glob exclusion deferred to a coverage-investment wave (follow-up filed).
- `@node-rs/xxhash` retained — 3 live imports in `src/main/codebaseGraph/` (named-import shape missed by initial bare-package grep; named-import-aware regex now the audit standard).
- `overrides.node-gyp: ^11.0.0` retained — load-bearing (commit `cf2bf63d`, distutils-removal-in-Python-3.12 fix). Phase 5 test confirmed removal re-introduces `app-builder-lib/node_modules/node-gyp@9.4.1` (the problematic version).
- `break: 21` is anti-backslide only; raising the floor is a deliberate decision in a future coverage-investment wave.

### Known issues
- Pre-existing 4 ESLint warnings (unused `eslint-disable` directives) in non-Wave-92 files — inherited from master, not touched in this wave.
- Pre-existing 515 prettier format inconsistencies — inherited from master, not in Wave 92's touched surface.
- `node-abi@4.31.0` EBADENGINE warning at Node 20 (transitive via `electron-builder`'s `app-builder-lib` — declares `>=22.12.0`). Cosmetic only; install + resolution succeed. Documented in `stryker-electron.md`.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Wave 88 — Terminal Foundation.** First wave of the chat-substrate migration (88→91): bug-sweeps the terminal subsystem, brings the ChatOnly shell's terminal dock to parity with the IDE shell, and migrates dock resize onto the shared `useResizable` hook — laying the foundation for Wave 89's stacked-terminal layout and Wave 90's interactive-Claude substrate.
  - **xterm v6 lifecycle correctness** (`useTerminalSetup.lifecycle.ts`): WebGL addon loads after `term.open()` per v6 guidance; `onContextLoss` disposes the addon and falls back to the canvas renderer without remount; the WebGL canvas is hidden before `dispose()` to eliminate a context-loss white flash; `_core` private-API access removed (cell height now derived from the DOM as `element.clientHeight / rows`, since xterm v6.0.0 exposes no public cell-size property).
  - **Addon manifest** (`terminalAddonManifest.ts`): declares all 9 `@xterm/*` addons with load-order (`pre-open` / `post-open`) and criticality.
  - **Dock resize unification** (`ChatWorkbenchTerminalDock.tsx`): the bespoke `useDockResize` hook is replaced by the shared `useResizable` hook, reusing the `terminal` PanelId; dock height persists via `panelSizes.terminal` (localStorage + electron-store) with a non-destructive one-time migration from the legacy `agent-ide:chat-workbench-terminal-dock` key.
  - **`ChatOnlyTerminalToolBridge`** (`ChatOnlyShell/ChatOnlyTerminalToolBridge.tsx`): scoped tool bridge mounted in `ChatWorkbenchShell` — routes `getTerminalOutput` to the dock's active session, returns a structured "unavailable in chat-only mode" envelope for file-viewer / file-tree tool calls. Backed by a 10-case orchestrator-owned acceptance test.
  - **Dock header parity + keybind** (`ChatWorkbenchTerminalDock.handlers.ts`, `useWorkbenchMenuEvents.ts`): New Claude / New Codex buttons + a recording toggle in the dock header; `Ctrl+J` toggles dock collapse, mirroring the IDE shell.

### Fixed
- **xterm `UnicodeGraphemesAddon` version string** — `term.unicode.activeVersion` was set to `'graphemes'`; the addon registers `'15-graphemes'`, so the grapheme-aware width provider never activated and threw on every terminal bootstrap.
- **Dock-height migration was destructive** — the legacy-key migration overwrote any user-set dock height with the stale legacy value; now guarded to apply only when the current height is still the default.
- **CI: Electron binary missing on cold-cache runners** — `npm ci --ignore-scripts` skipped electron's postinstall; CI now runs `node node_modules/electron/install.js` explicitly so test files importing `electron` / `electron-log` / `electron-store` can load. (Pre-existing failure, not a Wave 88 regression.)
- **Tailwind v4 CSS build crash** — an orphaned `.stryker-tmp/` sandbox was scanned by tailwind's auto-source walker; Windows paths inside it parsed as out-of-range Unicode escapes. Added a `@source not` exclusion + `.gitignore` entry.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-88-terminal-foundation/wave-88-decisions.md`)
- WebGL addon loads after `term.open()` (xterm v6 upstream guidance — the v5-era double-cursor issue was retired when v6 integrated cursor rendering into the WebGL canvas).
- Dock resize reuses the existing `terminal` PanelId rather than introducing a new persistence key — IDE shell and ChatOnly dock share `panelSizes.terminal` so both shells feel like the same product.
- `ChatOnlyShell` mounts a scoped `ChatOnlyTerminalToolBridge` rather than the full `IdeToolBridge` (which depends on `useFileViewerManager()`, unavailable in chat-only scope).

### Known issues
- master CI is red from pre-existing failures unrelated to Wave 88 (red since `0d6ee197`, before the wave) — tracked in `roadmap/bugs/2026-05-14-master-ci-ubuntu-windows-failures.md`. The Wave 88 CI fix (`install.js` step) eliminated the macOS Electron-binary collection failure (146 failed test files → 9). What remains: macOS + Ubuntu share a ~9-file platform-specific failure set, and the Windows Test step times out at 10 minutes. No platform is fully green yet.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Wave 85 — Flow Tracer (Phase 1 of "An IDE That Teaches You").** New centre-pane special view that traces a user-facing action through every layer of the running app — User → Renderer → Preload → Main → Claude CLI → Filesystem — with AI-written What/Why/How narration on each step. Opens via Command Palette (`Flow Tracer: Browse Flows` / `Flow Tracer: Search`), View menu (`View → Flow Tracer`), and a DOM event (`agent-ide:open-flow-tracer`).
  - **Boundary registry + trace engine** (`src/main/flowTracer/boundaryRegistry.ts`, `traceEngine.ts`): Tree-sitter scan of `src/main/**/*.ts` for `ipcMain.handle` registrations + `src/preload/**/*.ts` for bridge mappings; outbound trace via the codebase-memory graph's `trace_call_path`; layer detection per design spec §5.1; depth cap 6 (configurable via `flowTracer.maxDepth`, range 3-12); cycle collapse before topological sort.
  - **Per-symbol What+How narration cache** (`src/main/flowTracer/narrationCache.ts`): matches `moduleSummarizer.ts` pattern verbatim — `spawnClaude` CLI subprocess against `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, JSON output, 2-attempt retry, circuit-breaker after 3 failures, hash-based file cache at `<workspaceRoot>/.ouroboros/narration-cache/<symbolHash>.json`. Auth-constrained (no direct Anthropic API).
  - **Per-flow chain-aware Why** (`src/main/flowTracer/flowWhyCache.ts`): single CLI call per flow render with the ordered chain of symbols + their cached What+How as context; ask Haiku to name the invariant the user couldn't have guessed; cache to `<flowId>-why.json`.
  - **Canonical flow gallery** (`src/main/flowTracer/canonicalFlows.ts`): index-time CLI call extracts UI event handler + IPC handler candidates from the codebase-memory graph (~30-80 entries for Agent IDE) and asks Haiku for 8-15 pedagogically-valuable flow titles + entry-point symbols. `FALLBACK_FLOWS` provides cold-start coverage. Refresh button regenerates on demand.
  - **Natural-language search + disambiguation** (`src/main/flowTracer/nlResolver.ts` + `FlowSearchBar.tsx`): single Haiku CLI call with `{ query, candidates }`; top-5 ranked JSON; confidence > 0.8 resolves directly, else shows disambiguation dropdown.
  - **Persistence + Mermaid export** (`src/main/flowTracer/flowPersistence.ts`, `flowMermaidExport.ts`): save FlowTrace JSON to `<workspaceRoot>/.ouroboros/flows/<flowId>.json` with atomic temp-rename writes; `flowTracer.saveSharedFlows` setting (default `false`) opts into a `.ouroboros-shared/` location for intentional check-in; Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` export to clipboard.
  - **Renderer UX surfaces** (`src/renderer/components/FlowTracer/`): `FlowTracerView`, `FlowGallery`, `FlowSearchBar`, `FlowCanvas` (Canvas2D swimlane), `StepInspector` (What/How via `useStepNarration` hook + Why via `useFlowWhy` on hover), `FlowActions` (Save title input + Mermaid clipboard via `useFlowPersistence`), `SavedFlowsPanel`, `useCanonicalFlowsRefresh`. Centre-pane integration via existing `CentrePaneConnected.parts.tsx` special-view registration.
  - **IPC contract** (10 new channels): `flowTracer:get-canonical-flows`, `:trace-flow`, `:get-narration`, `:get-flow-why`, `:resolve-natural-language`, `:regenerate-gallery`, `:save-flow`, `:list-saved-flows`, `:load-flow`, `:export-mermaid`. Typed in `src/renderer/types/electron-flow-tracer.d.ts`; shared types in `src/shared/types/flowTracer.ts`.

### Architecture decisions (per `roadmap/wave-85-flow-tracer/wave-85-decisions.md`, ADR with 11 decisions)
- Match `moduleSummarizer.ts` for narration generation — auth-constrained pick, also industry-standard for bounded-candidate prompt decomposition.
- Hand-rolled swimlane-constrained topological sort (no d3-dag, no elkjs, no Mermaid runtime) — Phase 1 ships sequential-X positions; full topological sort deferred to polish.
- Tree-sitter for AST scanning (already in `package.json` via the codebase-memory graph indexer).
- LLM tool-call with bounded candidate list for NL resolution (per CODEXGRAPH NAACL 2025 + Sourcegraph's 2024 trajectory away from embeddings on bounded sets).
- Hybrid narration cache: per-symbol What+How (index-time, persistent) + per-flow Why (render-time, optionally cached).
- Centre-pane view; mini-tracer + click-to-trace + symbol-search deferred to Wave 86.
- Honeycomb test shape (cross-layer integration dominates); orchestrator-owned acceptance test predates Phase 1 implementation.
- 6-hop depth default, configurable. Saved flows local-only by default (`.ouroboros/` stays gitignored).

### Fixed (post-smoke iteration)
- **`drawSwimlane` runtime crash** — Phase 1 left a positional/destructured-arg mismatch on `drawEdges`/`drawStepNodes` call sites. Project tsconfig wasn't catching it; jsdom's null `getContext('2d')` skipped the bug in tests; manifested in the real browser. Fixed by passing object literals at call sites.
- **`canonicalFlows` renderer-event candidate extraction** — compound `(STARTS WITH 'handle' OR STARTS WITH 'on' OR ENDS WITH 'Handler')` clause unsupported by the codebase-graph compat queryGraph engine. Split into three single-condition queries with `(symbol|file|line)` dedupe; defensive `Array.isArray` guard on the return.
- **`listSavedFlows` crashing on Phase 4 cache files** — Phase 7's directory listing read every `*.json` in `.ouroboros/flows/` and tried `record.flow.metadata.layerCount`, which fails on Phase 4's `<flowId>-why.json` blobs (different shape). Filter `-why.json` from the listing.
- **Narration prompt missing symbol body** when graph line was stale. Added `rescueBodyByName`: if the line slice doesn't contain the symbol name as a word-bounded token, scan the file for the first declaration-shaped occurrence and re-slice.
- **Wasted 2nd narration CLI call** when Haiku replied with valid empty `[]` — added `isValidEmptyArrayResponse` short-circuit; record success, return empty Map, no retry.
- **Hover-panel "spasm"** — removing `onMouseLeave` clear so the inspector stays pinned to the last hovered step + memoizing `hoverRef` so `useStepNarration` doesn't refetch on every render. Smoke logs showed 30+ get-narration calls per second; now fires once per unique step.

### Open / Deferred
Three follow-ups filed for Wave 86 polish:
- **Diagram is rudimentary** (`roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-08-flow-tracer-diagram-rudimentary.md`). The swimlane render is numbered circles + lines; design spec called for layer-color-coded boxes, dashed async edges, boundary labels, LOD, CSS-token color resolution. Canvas2D scaffold is in place; replacing the placeholder draw functions is the work.
- **Trace engine output quality** (`roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-08-flow-tracer-trace-engine-quality.md`). Three sub-problems: bridge call expressions (`window.electronAPI.X`) surface as step symbols instead of resolving to main-side handlers; JS keywords (`delete`, etc.) surface as step symbols; every flow truncates at exactly 3 steps (likely depth-cap or boundary-resolution gap; needs instrumentation).
- **Narration body via graph snippet** (`roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-08-flow-tracer-symbol-body-via-graph-snippet.md`). `fetchSymbolBody` uses raw file slice; the design spec's referenced `get_code_snippet` graph API would be more robust to stale-line graph data. The `rescueBodyByName` fallback papers over the file-slice case for now.

### Documentation
- Wave 85 plan (`roadmap/wave-85-flow-tracer/waveplan-85.md` — 14 sections, validated against Sites 1/2/3 from `wave-process.md`).
- Wave 85 ADR (`roadmap/wave-85-flow-tracer/wave-85-decisions.md` — 11 decisions, all locked).
- Wave 85 mechanical review (`roadmap/wave-85-flow-tracer/wave-85-mechanical-review.md` — `/review` FLAG verdict, 6 findings, all non-fatal; the 4 dead-export findings now carry `DEFERRED-CONSUMER: wave-86` markers, the 2 universal-quantifier findings live in the trace-engine-quality follow-up).
- Design spec (`roadmap/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-flow-tracer-design.md`).
- Initiative framing (`ai/vision.md` — "An IDE That Teaches You" three-mode roadmap: Flow Tracer (this), inline captions (Wave 86), galaxy map (Wave 87)).

## [2.14.0] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Wave 82 — chat-only polish bundle (14 of 15 user-reported bugs).** Multi-round smoke walks across rounds 1-5 closed the bulk of the post-Lexical (v2.12.0) chat-only / chat-workbench surface defects:
  - **C1** chat add/delete row-flash — optimistic update; routes delete through the workspace's canonical action to remove the race with `useSyncStateIntoStore`.
  - **F1** FileViewer toolbar persistence — defensive fall-through in `renderInitialViewerState` so the toolbar stays mounted across the brief content=null transition during edit-mode toggles.
  - **F1c** Monaco minimap dual-scroll / residual decoration ruler — `verticalScrollbarSize: 0`, `verticalSliderSize: 0`, `useShadows: false`, plus disabled `overviewRulerLanes`/`overviewRulerBorder`/`hideCursorInOverviewRuler` when minimap is on.
  - **F2 / C3** chat-project binding (Wave 82.1 follow-up). Workbench `LayoutState.activeProject` is now mirrored into a per-workspace field on `AgentChatStore`; `ComposerContextPreview` and `WorkbenchRulesPanel` read from the store rather than `ProjectContext` (which is `multiRoots[0]` and isn't rail-aware). Prior symptom: rules popover showed 16 user / 0 project rules in either project; chat workspace stayed bound to the IDE's main root after rail switch.
  - **F4** menu collapse — "New Session" + "New Chat in Active Session" → single "New Chat" (Ctrl+N). The dispatched `WORKBENCH_NEW_SESSION_EVENT` is unchanged so the canonical handler chain (`handleCreateSession` → orchestration session row + thread + activation) is intact.
  - **G** artifact pane top-strip + Recent section removed; timeline outer card scroll fixed via `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-hidden` on the drawer aside so the inner list's `overflow-y-auto` actually engages.
  - **H2** image attachments now thread through `buildChatOnlyContextPreviewProps` → `ComposerContextPreview` → `useContextPreview` and appear as `attachment:`-prefixed entries in the popover's Files tab.
  - **B3** branch indicator removed from the chat-only status bar (`ChatOnlyStatusBar` was a separate mount, not just `StatusBar`).
  - **WorkbenchMenuBar.test.tsx** assertions updated for the F4 rename ("New Session" → "New Chat").

### Changed
- **Lint-debt cleanup folded into the wave.** Extracted `chatHistorySidebarCompletions.ts` (+ test) from `ChatHistorySidebar.tsx`; extracted `ContextPreview.popover.tsx` (+ test) from `ContextPreview.tsx` with a `PopoverContent` subcomponent split for the function-line cap; extracted `DockCloseButton` from `ChatWorkbenchTerminalDock.tsx`; dropped a stale `log.info` cold-boot trace from `FileTree.tsx`.

### Removed
- **Investigation trace logging** stripped after round-5 smoke confirmed the wave-82.x fixes are working: F1 instrumentation in FileViewer / FileViewerToolbar / FileViewerManager (`[trace:FileViewer]`, `[trace:EditBtn]`), rules-popover binding traces in AgentChatComposer / ComposerContextPreview (`[trace:rules]`), projectRoot mirror / body-effective / setActiveProject / TwoTierRailSurface render traces (`[trace:projectRoot]`, `[trace:rail]`), useRootTreeState cold-boot traces (`[trace:fileTree]`), `flushRuleLoadQueue` trace. Baseline structural warns kept (rail-validator divergence, `loadRoot` error path).

### Open / Deferred
- **B2 file-tree heat map** is not closed by this release. Round-5 smoke confirmed colored borders still don't appear after agent edits despite two attempted fixes in wave-82.x (extending `EDIT_TOOL_NAMES` to MCP-style names; `extractFilePath` JSON parse). Filed as `roadmap/follow-ups/2026-05-06-file-heat-map-still-broken.md` with repro steps and an instrumented investigation plan — next attempt requires runtime evidence per `~/.claude/rules/debug-before-fix.md`, not another code-read guess.

### Documentation
- Wave 82 plan / decisions / phase audits / auto-brief / handoff committed under `roadmap/wave-82-chat-only-polish-bundle/`.
- Wave 82.1 plan + result brief committed under `roadmap/wave-82.1-chat-project-binding/`.
- Outstanding follow-up digest as of 2026-05-03 captured at `roadmap/follow-ups/outstanding-2026-05-03.md` (~100 unique open items across Chat/UI, Telemetry, MCP, Graph, Performance, and prior-wave follow-ups).

## [2.13.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Wave 83 — Playwright-electron repro harness.** `npm run repro -- <slug>` driver runs `e2e/_repro-<slug>.spec.ts` against the built Electron app and writes artifacts (screenshot, console + network logs, optional video) under `artifacts/repro-<slug>-<timestamp>/`. Template at `e2e/_repro-template.spec.ts` includes a `reproArtifacts` helper for consistent artifact emission. Onboarding doc at `roadmap/docs/repro-harness.md`. Path A (consumer MCP exposure) and Path B (preload bridge) deferred — single npm-run path is the v1 surface.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Composer engine: rich-textarea → Lexical (Wave 81).** The chat composer now uses Lexical (`lexical` + `@lexical/react` + `lexical-beautiful-mentions`) instead of `rich-textarea`'s overlay model. Backspacing through `@` mentions no longer triggers the 2-3 second renderer freeze that motivated the wave — Lexical's immutable-node reconciliation only re-renders the affected text node per keystroke instead of re-tokenizing and re-rendering all spans. The `@`-dropdown is now driven by `BeautifulMentionsPlugin`'s `LexicalMentionMenuItem` (positioned above the cursor via a custom `menuComponent`); `/` slash commands still use the existing `SlashCommandMenu`, driven by a small custom `SlashCommandPlugin` that watches editor state. Backspace into a chip uses `showMentionsOnDelete={true}` for deterministic deletion — first backspace replaces the chip with the trigger char (`@`) and re-opens the menu, second backspace removes the `@` entirely. Bundle delta: +115 KB gz versus the pre-wave baseline.
- **Smoke-time fixes shipped with the cutover.** Backspace-on-chip now syncs to the chip-bar via a mutation listener + reconciler in `LexicalMentionBridge`. `useMentionSearch` no longer rebuilds the file index on every mention add/remove (residual stutter eliminated). Slash-command Enter selection now plumbs `slashCommandContext` + `onAddMention`, fixing the silent no-op on `/spec`/`/clear`/`/diff` etc. via Enter (mouse-click already worked). Selecting `/spec` with an empty draft no longer toasts "invalid feature name". Selected-item highlight in the slash + `@` menus changed from `bg-surface-overlay` (zero contrast against the menu container) to `bg-interactive-selection`. In-composer chip styling now visible via `theme.beautifulMentions['@']`. `LexicalMentionMenuItem` strips library-spread `option.data` props before forwarding to the `<li>` to silence React unknown-DOM-attribute warnings.

### Removed
- `rich-textarea` dependency. `LegacyRichTextarea` branch in `AgentChatComposerInput.tsx`. `AgentChatComposerHighlights.tsx` (overlay helper for the legacy textarea path) and its test. Dead helpers `tokenizeComposerHighlights` / `isComposerMentionHighlight` (`AgentChatComposerTypes.ts`) and `getTextareaStyle` (`AgentChatComposerSupport.ts`) along with their dedicated test files (`AgentChatComposerTypes.test.ts`, `AgentChatComposerMentions.test.ts`).

### Added
- **14 scoped vitest scripts + parallel `test:all` runner.** `npm test` runs the full suite (~5 min wall-clock) which consistently exceeded agent timeouts. The new `test:main` / `test:renderer` / `test:agentchat` / `test:lexical` / `test:layout` / `test:codebasegraph` / `test:orchestration` / `test:ipc` / `test:hooks` / `test:preload` / `test:web` / `test:shared` / `test:tools` / `test:filetree` scripts each finish in 30-120s. `npm run test:all` runs the full suite as 4 parallel vitest shards via `scripts/test-all-parallel.mjs` (~344s vs serial ~480s). CLAUDE.md documents the routing table for future agent runs.

### Documentation
- Wave 81 Phase A audit (`roadmap/wave-81-composer-engine-migration/phase-a-audit.md`) committed.
- Six gotcha entries appended to `src/renderer/components/AgentChat/CLAUDE.md` documenting the load-bearing Phase F decisions.
- `/spec featureName` Enter-send flow filed as a follow-up in `roadmap/follow-ups/follow-ups.md` — pre-existing structural break (the slash menu closes on whitespace, so the IDE-side `onSpec` never fires when the user types arguments after the command name). Fix path: add a send-time interceptor mirroring `useResearchIntercept`.

## [2.11.2] - 2026-05-02

### Performance
- **Chat composer hot-path fixes.** Live session investigation surfaced a 2-3 second renderer freeze when backspacing through inserted `@` mentions in the chat-only composer. Four compounding issues fixed:
  - `useProjectFileIndex` now skips `.claude/` (treated like `.git`); empty-`@` dropdown no longer flooded by command/rule/setting/worktree files.
  - `MentionAutocompleteSupport` replaces Fuse.js fuzzy search (300-450ms per call on a 5K-file index) with ranked substring matching (basename-prefix > basename-mid > dirname). Per-call cost ~3-5ms. 120ms debounce added on the query as defense-in-depth.
  - `useAgentChatThreadView` selector added (excludes `draft` + `canSend`); `AgentChatConversation`, `ConversationDrawer`, `ConversationBodyWithThread` switched to it. Previous selector caused full message-list reconciliation on every keystroke.
  - `mentionLabels` and `pinnedFileNames` memoized at the producer (`AgentChatComposer`) and consumer (`ComposerContextPreview`) boundaries; `useContextPreview` no longer recomputes 30+ times per keystroke. `buildChatOnlyContextPreviewProps` refactored to options-object signature.

### Fixed
- **Wave 79 transport-field cleanup completed.** Wave 79 removed `internalMcp.transport` from the config schema but missed `McpSpawnCostRecord.transport` in the downstream telemetry record type, causing a typecheck failure on master HEAD. Field removed from the type, the drain handler payload, and the test fixture.

### Chore
- ESLint import-sort and prettier autofix applied to nine pre-existing master-broken test files (`src/main/codebaseGraph/`, `src/main/ipc-handlers/`).

### Docs
- Wave 81 plan added: `roadmap/wave-81-composer-engine-migration/`. Migrates the chat composer from `rich-textarea` to Lexical with `lexical-beautiful-mentions` to address residual stutter not eliminated by this release's hot-path fixes (root cause: `rich-textarea`'s overlay-render-everything pattern).

## [2.11.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Upgrade-boot config validation.** Wave 79 removed deprecated config keys from the schema (`additionalProperties: false`) but did not migrate stored configs, so users upgrading from 2.10.x crashed at startup with `Config schema violation: routerSettings/codemode must NOT have additional properties`. `runConfigPreflight()` now strips the removed keys (`windowSessions`, `routerSettings.llmJudgeSampleRate`, `codemode.routeInternalMcp`, `internalMcp.transport`) idempotently before electron-store validates.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-05-02

Wave-burn batch — nine waves shipped in parallel from `roadmap/future/`.

### Added
- **Wave 72 — chat thread swipe navigation.** `useSwipeNavigation` mounted on `AgentChatWorkspace` root with wrap-around thread cycling; closes the Wave 32 Phase I deferral.
- **Wave 73 — skill executions persisted on chat messages.** `SkillExecutionRecord[]` now lands in SQLite via the assistant message record, so reopened historical threads show their skill executions in the details drawer (renderer falls back to persisted state when the live `AgentEventsContext` doesn't have the session).
- **Wave 75 — memory curation completion.** Inline drill-down preview for memory entries (Phase A) plus `memory:write` / `memory:delete` IPC handlers and edit/delete UI with atomic write-then-rename, idempotent delete, and confirmation modals (Phase B).
- **Wave 76 — warn-class hook decisions surface to agent.** `pre_tool_use.mjs` now emits structured JSON stdout (`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: 'allow'` + `systemMessage`) for `warn` decisions; `warnFullTestSuite` actually nudges the agent. Pattern documented in `roadmap/docs/hook-migration.md`.
- **Wave 77 — Cypher engine Wave A.** `OPTIONAL MATCH` (LEFT JOIN), `UNWIND` (VALUES CTE), multi-pattern `MATCH`, and `indexed_at` ISO→epoch coercion added to the mini-engine. `get_graph_schema` advertises `supportedCypherFeatures`. `STARTS WITH` / `ENDS WITH` no longer false-positive the unsupported-clause check.
- **Wave 78 — settings panel partial-wiring fixes.** webAccessPassword "✓ Password set" badge via `config:hasWebPassword`; useMcpHost main-process gating in `injectStandaloneMcpEntry`; `modelSlots.claudeMdGeneration` slot threaded into `buildProviderEnv`; `usageExport.defaultWindow` and `usageExport.lastDir` persisted across export sessions.
- **Wave 80 — graph edge confidence on CALLS.** Per-resolution-path confidence (import-resolved 0.95, same-file 0.85, name-unique 0.80, new-expression class 0.65) emitted at indexing time; `min_confidence` filter param on `trace_call_path` and `detect_changes` (default 0); `confidence` field disclosed in `get_graph_schema`.

### Changed
- **Wave 74 — IPC handler decomposition.** `miscRegistrars.ts` (336 lines, 10 unrelated domains) split into 8 named per-domain handler files (`updaterHandlers`, `costHandlers`, `usageHandlers`, `crashHandlers`, `shellHistoryHandlers`, `symbolHandlers`, `approvalHandlers`, `trustHandlers`). No behavior change; channel contract preserved. `misc.ts` imports the named registrars directly.

### Removed
- **Wave 79 — deprecated config keys removed (deprecation windows expired per audit).** `windowSessions`, `codemode.routeInternalMcp`, `internalMcp.transport`, `InjectOptions.transport`, and `InjectOptions.stdioTransportPath` deleted. `InjectOptions.stdioTransportPath` removal followed the audit-mandated 3-step order (caller → fixtures → field). `migrateWindowSessionsToSessions` removed; stale barrel re-export in `session/index.ts` cleaned up (caught by `/review`'s dead-export check).

### Process notes
- All nine waves drafted plans via `/wave-plan` and gap-checked via `/review` before merge. The mechanical review caught real defects in three waves (73 dead-value threading on the renderer side, 76 silent-drop in `notifyApprovalResolved`, 79 stale barrel re-export) — all self-corrected before merge. Each wave's artifacts live in its own `roadmap/wave-NN-{slug}/` folder.
- `/wave-plan` and `/review` slash commands updated in this batch to write into the per-wave folder convention introduced earlier.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Wave 60 — standalone Ouroboros MCP server.** The graph server now runs as a read-only stdio binary outside Electron and serves the same SQLite DB the IDE writes.
- **Codemode now proxies `context7` too.** A local stdio shim bridges Context7's HTTP MCP endpoint into the shared CodeMode gate so Claude Code and Codex both see it as `servers.context7` inside `execute_code`.

### Changed
- **Legacy bridge / mcpHost stack removed.** The old in-process `internalMcp` HTTP server, stdio bridge, port registry, and `mcpHost` subsystem were deleted in favor of the standalone server.
- **Release metadata updated.** Package version bumped to `2.8.0`, changelog advanced, and Wave 60 marked complete in the roadmap.

### Fixed
- **Build entry cleanup.** Removed the stale `mcpHostMain.ts` Vite input so production builds resolve cleanly.

## [2.7.13] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Wave 53l Phase A — codemode universal multiplex.** When `codemode.enabled: true`,
  the IDE patches `~/.claude.json mcpServers` once at startup with `__codemode_proxy`
  so EVERY Claude Code session — IDE-internal AND external terminal — sees the
  proxy. The per-spawn `acquireCodeModeForLaunch` short-circuits via
  `isCodeModeEnabled()` once the user-level enable runs.
- **Wave 53l Phase B — per-spawn routing default flipped.** With user-level CodeMode
  active steady-state, the routing policy no longer needs an opt-in flag. New
  `codemode.excludeFromMultiplex: string[]` config replaces the now-deprecated
  `codemode.routeInternalMcp`. Default behavior: ouroboros multiplexes through
  the proxy when `internalMcp.transport: 'stdio'`; opt out per-server via the
  exclude list.

### Fixed
- **Stdio bridge port decoupled from baked entry.** `internalMcpStdioTransport.ts`
  now resolves the live port at spawn time from `~/.claude/internalMcp-port.json`
  (written on every IDE start), rather than reading a port baked into the
  injected entry's args at enable time. Survives any number of IDE restarts.
- **Bridge health probe before SSE handshake.** Unreachable port → descriptive
  stderr line in `~/.claude/codemode-proxy.log` instead of opaque MCP
  CONNECTION_CLOSED.
- **Crash-recovery skip for ouroboros.** `maybeRestoreFromCrash` no longer
  applies a stale ouroboros entry from a prior session's managed-backup — the
  IDE's fresh injection is the source of truth for ouroboros lifecycle.
- **Codemode UX polish.** `__codemode_proxy` entry now sets `alwaysLoad: true`
  (skip tool-search deferral for the one-tool surface). Executor diagnoses
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'X')` with available-server
  hint. `execute_code` description spells out the explicit `return` requirement.

### Changed
- **Tool docstrings made prescriptive.** Graph tools (`search_graph`,
  `trace_call_path`, `get_code_snippet`, `query_graph`, etc.) now lead with
  "USE INSTEAD OF Grep when..." / "USE THIS for...". Project CLAUDE.md and
  `~/.claude/rules/graph-tool-routing.md` align: graph tools FIRST for symbol
  queries, Grep is the fallback.

## [2.7.12] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Wave 53k:** CodeMode end-to-end functional. The proxy was silently broken
  since Wave 53g (file-targeting regression cascaded into eight latent bugs
  the leak masked). Working agent path: `mcp__codemode_proxy__execute_code`
  → `servers.<name>.<tool>(...)` for `github`, `stripe`, `ouroboros` (graph
  tools). HTTP-only servers (`sentry`, `context7`) stay directly registered.
- `codemodeManager` now writes to `~/.claude.json` and `<root>/.mcp.json` (the
  files Claude Code CLI actually reads), not `~/.claude/settings.json`
  (Anthropic Desktop's file). Restoration data lives in the v2-schema sibling
  file `~/.claude/codemode-managed.json`.
- `scopedMcpConfig.readGlobalMcpServers()` corrected from the same wrong-file
  bug; user globals now flow through to the per-spawn temp config and the
  agent sees them under `--strict-mcp-config`.
- Project-scope multiplex now uses destructive write to `<root>/.mcp.json`
  (with verbatim restore on disable) because empirical testing in Claude
  Code v2.1.122 on Windows showed `--strict-mcp-config` doesn't isolate
  `.mcp.json` discovery and `disabledMcpjsonServers` flag is non-functional.
- Self-healing crash recovery: `enableCodeMode` checks for stale restoration
  files and applies them before starting a new enable.

### Changed
- `mcpClient.ts` and `proxyServer.ts` rewritten on `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
  (`Client`/`Server` + `StdioClientTransport`/`StdioServerTransport`),
  retiring ~280 lines of hand-rolled JSON-RPC. Mirrors the Wave 53j precedent
  for `internalMcpStdioTransport.ts`. SDK owns wire format (NDJSON, not the
  pre-fix LSP-style Content-Length framing), request correlation, and
  initialize handshake.
- HTTP/SSE upstreams (`url` field, no `command`) are filtered out at the
  `claudeCodeMode.resolveProxiedServerNames` boundary via the new
  `isStdioCapable()` predicate. They remain directly registered in
  `~/.claude.json mcpServers` and surface to the agent as `mcp__<name>__*`
  unchanged.
- `proxyServer.connectServerEntry` now races each upstream against a 15s
  startup deadline (was: blocked on `Promise.allSettled` for the slowest
  upstream's full 30s timeout — exhausted Claude Code's ~30s safety window).
- `~/.claude/codemode-proxy.log` — new diagnostic log file capturing every
  proxy spawn, upstream connect/fail, and shutdown event. Append-forever;
  truncate periodically if it grows large.

### Internal
- `codemodeManager.ts` split: public API surface delegates to
  `codemodeManagerFiles.ts` (paths + atomic JSON I/O + restoration record)
  and `codemodeManagerScopes.ts` (global vs project enable+restore).
- `proxyServer.js` path resolution: `resolveProxyServerPath()` walks
  sibling-then-parent so the registered path works regardless of bundle
  layout (electron-vite chunks the calling code into `out/main/chunks/`
  while `proxyServer.js` is at `out/main/`).
- Tailwind `@source not` glob extended to `roadmap/_archived/**` after
  archiving completed waves moved `wave-53c-output/` under it; Tailwind
  v4's auto-source scan trips on Windows path encodings (`\afa0da`-shaped
  hex segments) above U+10FFFF.
- Wave 53k ADR (`roadmap/_archived/wave-53k/wave-53k-decisions.md`) documents nine architecture
  decisions, including the Decision-2 reversal (toggle-flag → destructive
  write) and Decision 9 (SDK adoption pulled forward from a Wave 53m punt).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-20

Major release: dual-shell UI model. The IDE now ships with two top-level
shells that share the same main-process backend (sessions, threads, PTY,
hooks, config). Toggle between them via `Ctrl+Alt+I`, the View menu, or
Settings → Immersive chat mode.

### Added
- **Chat-only shell** (Wave 42): single-column immersive chat interface modelled
  on Claude desktop, Codex, and piebald.ai. Mounts `AgentChatWorkspace` full-width
  with a minimal title bar, off-canvas session drawer, minimal status bar, and
  full-screen `DiffReviewPanel` overlay. Pop-out chat windows (`?mode=chat`)
  route to this shell automatically.
- `layout.immersiveChat` config flag; keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+I`;
  Settings entry; dynamic "Switch to / Exit Chat Mode" View menu item.
- `useImmersiveChatFlag` hook; `ChatOnlyShellWrapper` provider stack;
  hoisted `TOGGLE_IMMERSIVE_CHAT_EVENT` + `TOGGLE_SESSION_DRAWER_EVENT`
  constants in `appEventNames.ts`.
- Lazy config store (`configStoreLazy`) with preflight sanitization
  (`configPreflight`) for startup reliability under worker-thread contention
  and transient schema-mismatch states.

### Changed
- `IdeToolBridge` is intentionally not mounted in the chat-only shell.
  IDE-context tool queries (`getOpenFiles`, `getActiveFile`, `getSelection`,
  `getUnsavedContent`, `getTerminalOutput`) return empty — matches Claude
  desktop's behaviour. Option for cross-window delegation is deferred.
- `AutoSyncWatcher.triggerReindex` routes through `getIndexingWorkerClient()`
  singleton to avoid SQLite WAL-lock contention with initial-index workers
  that previously froze the UI for 20–30s.
- `handleActive` IPC handler falls back to `windowManager.getWindow(id)?.
  activeSessionId` when the renderer hasn't explicitly called `sessionCrud:
  activate`. Fixes session-bound actions for freshly-opened windows.
- `preload.ts` fans out `config:externalChange` through a single underlying
  `ipcRenderer.on` listener with a subscriber set, avoiding EventEmitter's
  default-cap warning at 11 subscribers.
- `optimizeDeps.force` in dev is now opt-in via `FORCE_OPTIMIZE_DEPS=1`
  (was always-on). Saves 20–30s on dev cold starts.
- `graphWorker` entry renamed to `indexingWorker` in electron-vite config
  to match the source module name.

### Fixed
- `EdgeDropZones` now gates pointer events on `useDndContext().active` —
  invisible edge zones no longer swallow all clicks/hovers/keyboard-focus
  routing when no drag is in flight.
- Worker-thread safety: `agentChatThreadStore` and its path constants are
  now lazy / gated by `isMainThread`, so worker threads that transitively
  import the module no longer crash on module load.
- `ThreadStoreSqliteRuntime.initSchema` always runs column migrations
  (idempotent via `hasCol`). Repairs DBs that were left in a half-migrated
  state by a prior broken migration condition.
- `indexingPipeline.ts` and `settingsEntries.ts` split along natural
  seams to satisfy `max-lines:300` without `eslint-disable` directives.

### Removed
- Two `eslint-disable max-lines` directives that were added as a short-term
  workaround. Both underlying files have been properly split.
