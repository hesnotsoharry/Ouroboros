# IPC Handlers — Domain-split `ipcMain.handle()` registrars

All Electron IPC handler registration lives here. Each file is a domain registrar that binds `ipcMain.handle()` calls and returns a list of registered channel names. Imported and orchestrated by `../ipc.ts`.

## Registration Pattern

Every registrar follows the same contract:

```ts
export function registerXxxHandlers(senderWindow: SenderWindow): string[] {
  const channels: string[] = [];
  ipcMain.handle('domain:action', handler);
  channels.push('domain:action');
  return channels;
}
```

- **Returns `string[]`** of registered channel names — used by `ipc.ts` for deduplication/logging.
- **`senderWindow`** resolves `IpcMainInvokeEvent` → `BrowserWindow` for sending events back to the renderer.
- Some registrars also export a `cleanup*` function (watchers, subscriptions).

Two co-existing signatures exist: primary domain registrars (exported in `index.ts`, called by `../ipc.ts`) and sub-registrars (aggregated into `misc.ts`, receiving a shared channel list). New domain handlers go in their own named `*Handlers.ts` file; `misc.ts` imports them directly.

## Response Convention

All handlers return `{ success: true, ...data }` or `{ success: false, error: string }`. Each file defines local type aliases (`HandlerSuccess<T>`, `HandlerFailure`) — don't import them across files.

## Path Security

`pathSecurity.ts` has three distinct guards — pick based on context:

| Function | Use when |
|---|---|
| `assertPathAllowed(event, path)` | User-supplied path inside the active workspace |
| `isTrustedConfigPath(path)` | Path is a `.md` file in `~/.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/rules/` |
| `isTrustedVsxExtensionPath(path)` | Path is inside `~/.ouroboros/vsx-extensions/` (icon themes, fonts) |

Call `assertPathAllowed` before any filesystem touch on a user-supplied path:
```ts
const denied = assertPathAllowed(event, targetPath);
if (denied) return denied;
```

Validates against: per-window project roots (from `windowManager`) + configured multi-roots + `defaultProjectRoot`. Windows paths are compared case-insensitively. Denies by default if no workspace root is configured.

ESLint's `security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename` fires even on trusted paths (e.g. `app.getPath('userData')` + `readdir` results). Suppress with an explanatory comment — do not disable the rule file-wide.

## Gotchas

- **`agentChat.ts` is a re-export hub**: `files.ts` and `git.ts` import context cache helpers from `agentChat.ts`, not directly from `agentChatContext.ts`. This is intentional — don't "clean up" those imports.
- **`misc.ts` is the thin aggregator**: It imports named per-domain registrars directly. New domains get their own `*Handlers.ts` file; add the import + call in `misc.ts`.
- **Web client broadcasts**: Handlers pushing events to the renderer (watchers, config changes, agent chat events) must also call `broadcastToWebClients()` from `../web/webServer` for web-mode parity.
- **No AgentLoopController**: Was removed as dead code. `agentChatOrchestration.ts` is a minimal factory. Don't re-introduce a controller layer.
- **Channel naming**: `domain:action` format throughout (e.g. `files:readFile`, `git:status`). PTY data channels embed session ID: `pty:data:${id}`.
- **ESLint limits**: 40 lines/function, complexity 10. Large registrars extract pure helpers into companion `*Helpers.ts` files to stay compliant.
- **Session pruning**: `sessions.ts` caps at 100 JSON files, pruning oldest by `mtime` automatically.
- **Git-backed UI indicators MUST route through a cache**: `git:branch` and `git:isRepo` are each queried by ~9 simultaneous renderer consumers on mount (title bar, status bar, InnerRail, UnifiedRail, file-tree branch indicator, dropdown). Per-consumer × per-root fan-out spawned a stampede of `git` child processes; on Windows, process-spawn contention turned that into 1.7–4.9s handler latency + event-loop jank. Both now use module-scoped TTL + in-flight-dedup caches (`gitBranchCache.ts` 5s TTL, `gitRepoStatusCache.ts`). Any NEW git-backed indicator must route through such a cache — never call git per-mount. Invalidate the branch cache on `git:checkout` / `git:commit`.
